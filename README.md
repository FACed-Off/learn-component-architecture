# Learn Component Architecture

It's easy to end up with a big mess of spaghetti code when working with the DOM. This workshop will cover some techniques for structuring your frontend code so that it's easier to work with and scale up to a larger app. It will also introduce common patterns that are used in frameworks like React.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and you should see a basic counter. The `+` button makes the number go up by one each time you click it.

Open `workshop/counter.js` in your editor and read through the code. We'll be refactoring this in the next section.
